# SpamClassifier

# We Have used NLP to train the Machine Learning model with the message text.

# Steps To perform NLP

# Step-1: Import the Data from the Dataset (Hint: Make sure that the data need to be separated from input and ouput)
# Step-2: Take the text column and remove the special charectors by using regix
# Step-3: The input data need to be tokeanized to words.
# Step-4: Now the words need to be Stemming/Lemmatization after removing the stopwords
# Step-5: Collect all the documents and append to a corpus list
# Step-6: Apply BOW(Bag Of Words) are TF-IDF(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to the corpus list to convert words to vectors.
# Step-7: Now take the output of TF-IDF are BOW to X and dependent variable to y and make Train Test Split.
# Step-8: Perform All the Machine Learning models on the Train dataset and pick top one model by the performace report of the models.

# A basic NLP Project that to classify the Mails are SPAM are Nonspam using the message body in the mail.
